            At Artemis, our mission is to leverage the power of technology and
            human compassion to improve the lives of stray animals in local
            communities. Through our crowd-sourced platform, we enable users to
            upload photos of stray animals in their area that require attention
            or assistance. Our primary objective is to contribute to the
            reduction of stray animal populations on the streets by facilitating
            their rescue, rehabilitation, and adoption.
          </p>

            Inspired by the love and compassion that people have for animals and
            drawing from the legacy of Artemis, the Greek God associated with
            animals and their protection, we strive to create a better world for
            stray animals. We believe that every animal deserves care, love, and
            a chance at a fulfilling life.
          </p>

            Artemis was born during Chingu&apos;s 44th Voyage, which took place
            from May 1st, 2023 to June 11th, 2023. We are driven by a passionate
            community of individuals who came together with the shared purpose
            of making a positive impact on the lives of stray animals.

            animals.
